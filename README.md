# README.md

This is my second weeb dev project so far. 

### Technologies:
The site uses HTML and CSS only. In terms of responsiveness, the site is only utilising flex to acomplish that.

### What have I learned?
I learned working with immages, adding a font from the web, making everything look nice with a good color scheme, and slowly getting the hang of creating something step by step, without getting lost in the code mid way. 
The css could be optimised for sure, and some of the values are quite repetitive - tbat could be fixed with a better choice of selectors. For a first project like this, I'm extremely proud at the site I've created :D

Thanks to the Odin project for providing such a well planned out, consise course!

The immages are not owned by me. Sources:
